    I want you to generate synthetic customer review data in the format:

    Review 1: The speaker is compact and easy to carry.
    Review 2: Sound quality is impressive for the price.
    Review 3: Battery life could be better.
    Review 4: Great value overall, but lacks bass.
    Review 5: I use it at the beach all the time, super convenient.

    Generate longer example reviews about any product that you'd like, but only talk about one product. Output only the reviews in the format above and nothing else.
